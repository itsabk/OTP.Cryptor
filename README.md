# OTP.Cryptor
OTP Cryptor is a mobile application that aims to demonstrate the one-time pad encryption methodology.

Initially, the app was created on Unity Engine (as I started developing on Unity at the time) as project for a 'Information Security' course back in university. The plan is to further develop the app on various frameworks, which will provide a hands-on experience and then can be used to study the differences between the framweworks.
